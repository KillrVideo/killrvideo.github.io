        <h1 id="adding-pub-sub-messaging">Adding Pub-Sub Messaging</h1>
<p>KillrVideo is architected to use <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html" target="_blank">events for service collaboration</a>. This
means that the services publish events about interesting things that happen (i.e. when state
changes occur) and other services are free to subscribe to those events and react. As a
result, you&#39;ll need to setup some kind of messaging infrastructure that supports pub-sub.
We&#39;ve defined the events published by each service in Protocol Buffers files that are located
next to each service&#39;s definition in the <a href="https://github.com/KillrVideo/killrvideo-service-protos" target="_blank">killrvideo-service-protos</a> project
that you used when <a href="/docs/development/generate-service-code/">Geneterating Service Code</a>.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-recommendations">Implementation Recommendations</h2>
<p>Since this is a reference application and all the gRPC service implementations will be running
in-process together so users can debug them, the simplest way to do pub-sub messaging is via
some in-memory mechanism. Some programming languages may already have an in-memory message bus
implementation available (for example, in Java we have the <a href="https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained" target="_blank">Guava EventBus</a> 
available). If you don&#39;t have an in-memory implementation available, it&#39;s usually pretty 
straightforward to create a simple one of your own.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a real piece of messaging infrastructure like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
Since KillrVideo uses Docker Compose for spinning up all the dependencies needed by a user in
their development environment, it&#39;s possible to piggyback on that and spin up a container
using messaging infrastructure of your choice. You would go about doing this by adding it to
the <code>docker-compose.yaml</code> file as another service.</p>
<p>While we don&#39;t want to give a hard rule on how to accomplish pub-sub messaging, it&#39;s 
<strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you go down the easy route of doing things in-memory. Try and
hide the implementation details from your consumer code and provide a generic API for 
publishing and subscribing to events. That way you could switch the implementation out (or
provide multiple available implementations as further examples) for real messaging 
infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="what-services-should-subscribe-to-what-events-">What services should subscribe to what events?</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the section on <a href="/docs/development/implement-services/">Implementing Services</a>, you should be 
using the other programming language implementations as a reference. They will always contain
the latest examples of services subscribing to and reacting to events from other services. At
the time of writing, these are the events you&#39;ll want to subscribe to.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Event Name</th>
<th>Published By</th>
<th>Subscribed To By</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>UploadedVideoAdded</code></td>
<td>VideoCatalogService</td>
<td>SearchService</td>
<td>Allows the SearchService to update its collection of tags and videos by tag as new videos are added.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>YouTubeVideoAdded</code></td>
<td>VideoCatalogService</td>
<td>SearchService</td>
<td>Allows the SearchService to update its collection of tags and videos by tag as new videos are added.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Just because an event doesn&#39;t currently have any subscribers doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t be
published. Make sure you refer to the event definition&#39;s <code>.proto</code> files for each service and
the other language implementations for what events to publish and when to publish them.</p>
