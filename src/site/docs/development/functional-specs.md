# Microservice Functional Specifications

Implementations of The KillrVideo microservice tier are provided in multiple languages including Java, C#, 
and JavaScript. The syntax of the operations supported by the services are defined in the GRPC contracts. 
However, the GRPC contracts don't specify the behavior supported by each operation.

To facilitate the creation of implementations in additional languages, we provide here the functional
specifications for each service.

_Note: This page is a work in progress._

## User Management Service
This service supports adding user profiles, verifying user credentials against a profile, and retrieving
one or more profiles.
 
_Note: This service could be extended to allow updating and deleting user profiles._

### CreateUser operation
This operation creates a new user in the KillrVideo system

#### Inputs
- `user_id` - a unique ID generated by the client requesting the user creation (required)
- `first_name` - first name of the user (required)
- `last_name` - last name of the user (required)
- `email` - user's email address, must be unique and a valid email address format (required)
- `password` - user's desired password (required)

#### Behavior
1. Validate input
1. Insert records representing the new user into the `users` and `user_credentials` tables.
    - This should be done using a lightweight transaction (LWT) to ensure the user email does not already exist. If
    the user already exists an error is reported. 
    - The password should be stored as a hashed value rather than the actual password for security purposes.
1. Publish a `UserCreated` event.

#### Output
This method returns no results.

### VerifyCredentials operation
This operation checks user provided credentials (email and password) and returns the appropriate
user ID if successful.

#### Inputs
- `email` - user's email address (required)
- `password` - user's password (required)

#### Behavior
1. Retrieve the credentials from the `user_credentials` tables, using the provided `email`.
    - Return an error if the record is not found
1. Hash the provided `password` and compare it to the hashed `password` retrieved from the database
    - Return an error if the hashed values do not match
    
#### Output
If the credentials are correct, this method returns the `user_id` associated with the credentials.

### GetUserProfile operation
Gets a user or group of user's profiles

#### Inputs
- `user_ids` - a list of unique IDs representing the account profiles to be returned

#### Behavior
1. Validate that at least one user account is requested
1. Retrieve the account profiles from the `users` table by ID
    - Hint: using the CQL `IN` clause to request multiple profiles in a single request, 
    or using multiple requests for single profiles requested asynchronously in parallel are
    both valid ways to get the profiles.

#### Output
This method returns a `profile` object for each profile it was able to load successfully, or an error if
zero results were found (partial success is ok).
- `user_id` - unique identifier for the user
- `first_name` - first name of the user
- `last_name` - last name of the user
- `email` - user's email address

## Video Catalog Service
This service supports adding videos, retrieving videos, and retrieving video previews for
recent videos and specific users.

### SubmitUploadedVideo operation
This operation submits an uploaded video to the catalog.

_Note: this operation is currently unused because of its association with the Uploads Service_

### SubmitYouTubeVideo operation
This operation submits a YouTube video to the catalog. The actual video is not stored into KillrVideo, only the metadata.

#### Inputs
- `video_id` - unique identifier for the video generated by the client (required)
- `user_id` - unique identifier of the user uploading the video (required)
- `name` - name or title of the video (required)
- `description` - synopsis of the video (required)
- `tags` - list of tags to associate with the video 
- `you_tube_video_id` - string representing the unique identifier used by YouTube for this video. (required)

#### Behavior
1. Validate input
1. Insert records representing the new user into the `videos`, `latest_videos` and `user_videos` tables.
    - These inserts should be grouped in a logged batch to ensure they succeed or fail together. 
    - The tables include a column to store a preview image location. For YouTube videos this location can be calculated 
    from the YouTube video ID according to the pattern: `//img.youtube.com/vi/<ID>/hqdefault.jpg`
1. Publish a `YouTubeVideoAdded` event.

#### Output
This method returns no results.

### GetVideo operation
This operation gets a video and all its details from the catalog.

#### Inputs
- `video_id` - unique ID representing the video to be returned

#### Behavior
1. Retrieve the video details from the `videos` table by ID

#### Output
This method returns the following details for the video if it was able to load successfully:
- `video_id` - unique identifier for the video 
- `user_id` - unique identifier of the user who uploaded the video 
- `name` - name or title of the video 
- `description` - synopsis of the video
- `location_type` - `YOUTUBE` (0) or `UPLOAD` (1, unused)
- `tags` - list of tags associated with the video 
- `location` - `you_tube_video_id` for a YouTube video, or URL for an uploaded video
- `added_date` - Date / time the video was added to the system

### GetVideoPreviews Operation
This operation gets video previews for a limited number of videos from the catalog

#### Inputs
- `video_ids` - a list of unique IDs representing the video previews to be returned

#### Behavior
1. Retrieve the video preview details from the `videos` table by ID

#### Output
This method returns the following details for each video it was able to load successfully:
- `video_id` - unique identifier for the video 
- `user_id` - unique identifier of the user who uploaded the video 
- `name` - name or title of the video 
- `preview_image_location` - string representing URL of the preview image
- `added_date` - Date / time the video was added to the system

### GetLatestVideoPreviews Operation
This operation gets video previews for the latest (i.e. newest) videos from the catalog

#### Inputs
- `page_size` - max number of videos to be returned in a single response (required)
- `starting_added_date` - starting Date / Time for the search (optional)
- `starting_video_id` - unique ID of the last video from the previous request (optional)
- `paging_state` - paging state returned from the previous request (optional)

#### Behavior
1. Retrieve the video preview details from the `latest_videos` table, using any paging state provided.
    - For details of the algorithm see this [blog post][paging-blog]

#### Output
This method returns an optional paging state, and the following details for each video it was able to load successfully:
- `video_id` - unique identifier for the video 
- `user_id` - unique identifier of the user who uploaded the video 
- `name` - name or title of the video 
- `preview_image_location` - string representing URL of the preview image
- `added_date` - Date / time the video was added to the system

### GetUserVideoPreviews Operation
