# Microservice Functional Specifications

Implementations of The KillrVideo microservice tier are provided in multiple languages including Java, C#, 
and JavaScript. The syntax of the operations supported by the services are defined in the GRPC contracts. 
However, the GRPC contracts don't specify the behavior supported by each operation.

To facilitate the creation of implementations in additional languages, we provide here the functional
specifications for each service.

This page is a work in progress.

## User Management Service

### CreateUser operation
This operation creates a new user in the KillrVideo system

#### Inputs
- `user_id` - a UUID generated by the client requesting the user creation (required)
- `first_name` - first name of the user (required)
- `last_name` - last name of the user (required)
- `email` - user's email address, must be valid email address format (required)
- `password` - user's desired password (required)

#### Behavior
1. Validate input
1. Insert records representing the new user into the `users` and `user_credentials` tables.
    - This should be done using a lightweight transaction (LWT) to ensure the user does not already exist. If
    the user already exists an error is reported.
    - The password should be stored as a hashed value rather than the actual password for security purposes.
1. Publish a `UserCreated` event.

#### Output
This method returns no results.
